**Task:**

For each statement, create a flowchart `on paper` and its associated pseudocode.

**Program Statements:**

1.  **Conditional Sum of Even Numbers:** Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer `n`.
    - The program must sum all the even numbers from 2 up to `n`, but only if `n` is greater than or equal to 10.
    - If `n` is less than 10, it should print a message indicating that the number is too small.

2. **Multiplication Table with Limit:** Create a program that asks the user for an integer `x` (the base of the table) and an integer `l` (the limit).
    - The program should display the multiplication table of `x` from 1 to `l`, but stopping if the product exceeds 50.

3. **Guess the Number (with hints):** Design a game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
   - The user has to guess the number. After each attempt, the program should indicate whether the entered number is greater or smaller than the secret number.
   - The game ends when the user guesses the number or after 7 attempts.

4. **Vowel Counter:** Write a program that asks the user to enter a phrase.
   - The program must count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) that the phrase contains (both uppercase and lowercase).

5. **Average Calculator with Grade Limit:** Create a program that asks the user to enter a series of grades (floating-point numbers).
    - The program should continue asking for grades until the user enters a negative number.
    - Then, the program should calculate the average of the entered grades, but only if at least 5 valid grades were entered.
    - If fewer than 5 grades were entered, it should display an error message.

**Additional Tips**

*   **Try:** Don't just copy the solutions. Try to do it without looking at the solutions or AI help.
*   **Divide and conquer:** If a problem seems too complicated, try to divide it into smaller, more manageable problems.
*   **Practice:** Programming is a skill that develops with practice. The more you practice, the better developers you will become.
